# Project Index

Welcome to my project showcase. Here you'll find a collection of my work across various domains including 3D printing, electronics, cybersecurity, and homelab setups.

## 3D Printing

#### [3D Print Cost Calculator](/projects/3dpcc)

Java application (CLI and web UI) used to estimate 3D printing costs by considering material usage, energy consumption, and optional commission.

**Technologies:** Java, JavaScript, HTML/CSS  
**Status:** Completed

#### [TOYO STEEL T-190 Toolbox Organizer Trays](https://www.printables.com/model/1193917-toyo-steel-t-190-toolbox-organizer-trays-wowstick)

Custom organizer trays for the TOYO STEEL Trunk Toolbox (T-190 series) to efficiently store and organize tools, small parts, and accessories. These trays fit perfectly inside the toolbox and provide dedicated compartments for various repair tools.

**Technologies:** Fusion 360, PLA  
**Status:** Completed

#### [Decorative Cube Grid Panels](https://www.printables.com/model/1087884-decorative-cube-grid-panels)

Decorative cube grid panels designed for the front of the Corsair 110R PC case.

**Technologies:** SketchUp, PLA  
**Status:** Completed

## Electronics

#### [Kindle Unbrick](/projects/kindle-unbrick)

How I fixed a bricked Kindle after a failed jailbreak attempt.

**Technologies:** serial/TTY, soldering, serial monitor  
**Status:** Completed

#### [ESP32 Morse Code Transmitter](/projects/esp32-morse)

Uses EPS-NOW to connect two ESP32s. Pressing a button on one triggers a vibration on the other, providing a simple way to send and receive Morse code messages.

**Technologies:** Arduino  
**Status:** Beta | Archived

#### [DTMF Message Encryption](https://github.com/rh45-one/DTMF-Encryption)

This project aims to transmit text messages using DTMF tones encrypted using a dynamic key. These tones will be transmitted using PMR446 radios (no HAM licence required) and will provide a legal and secure off-grid method of communication.

**Technologies:** Python  
**Status:** Incomplete | Archived

**Technologies:** Python, Raspberry Pi, ELK Stack  
**Status:** Beta

#### [Password Manager CLI](/projects/pass-cli)

Lightweight command-line password manager with strong encryption and optional cloud synchronization.

**Technologies:** Rust, AES-256, Git  
**Status:** Active Development

## Homelab

#### [Docker Infrastructure](/projects/homelab-docker)

My personal containerized infrastructure for self-hosting applications, including media services, automation, and development environments.

![Docker Infrastructure](/img/projects/docker-infrastructure.jpg)

**Technologies:** Docker, Docker Compose, Traefik, Portainer  
**Status:** Continuously Evolving

#### [Network Monitoring Dashboard](/projects/network-dashboard)

Comprehensive network monitoring solution tracking device status, bandwidth usage, and system health.

**Technologies:** Grafana, Prometheus, Node Exporter  
**Status:** Production
